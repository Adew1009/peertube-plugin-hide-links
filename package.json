Purpose and Functionality
This plugin is designed to hide the "Channels" and "Videos" links from the left menu in PeerTube when a user has zero video upload quota. This functionality serves several purposes:

Resource Management: It prevents users who have reached their quota limit from attempting to create channels or videos.
Abuse Prevention: It helps maintain the integrity of the platform by limiting access to certain features based on usage rights.
User Experience: It provides clear feedback to users about their account status regarding video uploads.
Open Source: Being licensed under AGPL-3.0, it promotes transparency and community involvement in the development and maintenance of the plugin.
Version Compatibility: By specifying the minimum required PeerTube version, the author ensures that the plugin remains compatible with future updates of the platform.
This plugin demonstrates good practices in plugin development for PeerTube, including proper documentation, version control, and consideration of both server-side and client-side requirements.
