// This code defines a module that exports two asynchronous functions: register and unregister.

async function register ({
  registerHook,
}) {

}
// This function is defined as async, which means it can contain await expressions inside its body. However, the function body is currently empty.
// The parameter destructuring { registerHook } suggests that this function expects an object with at least one property registerHook. This property is likely a function passed in from the parent scope, probably used to register hooks in a plugin system.

async function unregister () {
  return
}

// This function is also defined as async, though it doesn't have any await expressions. The function body simply returns without doing anything (return).

module.exports = {
  register,
  unregister
}

// Purpose and Usage
// This module seems to be part of a plugin system where:

// register is used to set up initial configurations or bindings when the plugin is installed.
// unregister is likely intended to clean up resources or remove bindings when the plugin is uninstalled or deactivated.
// However, the current implementation of unregister doesn't actually do anything. It might need to be expanded to include cleanup operations.

// Potential Improvements
// The register function could be implemented to perform necessary setup operations.
// The unregister function could be expanded to handle cleanup tasks.
// Error handling could be added to both functions to manage potential issues during registration/unregistration.

// async function register ({
//   registerHook,
// }) {
//   try {
//     // Perform setup operations here
//     await registerHook({
//       // Define hooks here
//     });
//     console.log('Plugin registered successfully');
//   } catch (error) {
//     console.error('Failed to register plugin:', error);
//     throw error; // Re-throw to propagate the error
//   }
// }

// async function unregister () {
//   try {
//     // Perform cleanup operations here
//     console.log('Plugin unregistered successfully');
//   } catch (error) {
//     console.error('Failed to unregister plugin:', error);
//     throw error; // Re-throw to propagate the error
//   }
// }
