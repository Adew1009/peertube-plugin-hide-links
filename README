# PeerTube Plugin: Hide Links

This plugin hides the "Channels" and "Videos" links from the left navigation when a logged-in user has zero video upload quota.

## Installation

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Install the plugin using the PeerTube CLI or the admin panel.

No further setup is required as the plugin is already built and ready to use.
